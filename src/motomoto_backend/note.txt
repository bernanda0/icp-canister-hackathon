1. Airport staff = addBaggageData(...)
   - baggage_id 
   - owner = user_id
   ...
   TODO : add phone number 

2. User = init(baggage_id, user_id)

   User can subscribe to many baggage_id s 
   (as long as they're the owner of the baggage)

3. User = getSubscribedBag(user_id)
   
   Key     | List<>
   --------+-------------------
   user_id | [b1, b2, b3, ...]
   
4. Airpot = publish(...)

   The "airport" update the baggage status
   triggering the callback function which is the updateFunction

5. User = getBaggageData(baggage_id)

   // TODO : add user_id param to authenticate the user_id
   it's polling the API :'''') maybe every 10 seconds?
